## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a pretty quick solution to figure out. I began by using `display: grid` but had issues figuring out how to set the margins correctly. After fudging around with it for a while, I decided to go with Flexbox for the layout and that made things simpler.

### Continued development

I would like to better understand when and how to use grid layout. I know it is a powerful tool and perhaps this solution was too simple for it to be an effective tool. Flexbox was a simpler implementation. However, I want to learn to implement `display: grid` better.

### Useful resources

- [Grid Design by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duH4DLq5yoo) - Kevin Powell did a great job explaining grid and how to use it. It will definitely come back to his video to further learn how to implement `display: grid`

Thanks to [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) and her [Web Development Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy. I have made tremendous strides understanding the fundamentals of Web Development and in turn being able to complete this challenge as quickly as I did with her help.
